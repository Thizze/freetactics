This project's aim is to replicate the exact behaviour of the original Final Fantasy: Tactics Advance engine whilst allowing for full customization of the game's resources to allow for new scripts, classes, enemies and entirely new worlds.

Also as part of an extra feature of the engine it will support a GBA-style mode which will retain identical gameplay to the original game, and a new PC mode which will have a much higher resolution and level of quality for the game's resources, and added mouse support, netplay supporting up to 16 players per team with 4 teams per field in online battles.
